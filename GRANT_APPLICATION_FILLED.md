## Part 2: 项目详情

### 2.1 问题陈述 (What problem are you solving?)

```
Current Web3 Gaming Problems:

1. Unsustainable Economics
   • Most P2E games have severe token inflation
   • Player earnings < Player spending
   • Early adopters dump tokens, late buyers lose money
   
   Example: Axie Infinity (AXS) dropped 98% from $165 to $3

2. Poor Game Quality
   • Games are just "wrappers" for token launches
   • Zero gameplay depth or strategy
   • Repetitive grind with no fun

3. Bad User Experience
   • Complex wallet connections
   • High gas fees (ETH: $10+ per transaction)
   • Long confirmation times (ETH: 15+ minutes)

4. Centralization Risks
   • Central teams can change rules anytime
   • No transparency in token allocation
   • Players have no rights or protections

Our Solution:
• Healthy 10:1 player ROI (revenue > spending)
• Deep gameplay with 5 core loops
• Solana's 400ms confirmation + <$0.001 fees
• Transparent, community-governed ecosystem
```
